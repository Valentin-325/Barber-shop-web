Everything is built by me from scratch and I can prove it. To navigate this website we have built a responsive menu that can be functional on any type of device. 
To move from one section to another I used smoth scroll so as not to have a sudden transition effect. Over the image on the first page (Home) I added an overlay 
to provide a good contrast. In the "Portfolio" section we used the properties of the grid to be able to keep the design responsive. 
I also used flexbox to place the elements on the page. For the hamburger menu we used "addEventListener" to add an event when we press the menu button.
